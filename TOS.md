# TERMS OF SERVICE

## Background
These Terms of Service (hereafter TOS) define the responsibilities of Automated Data Extraction Platform (hereafter ADEPT) account holders (hereafter USERS) with respect to proper and acceptable use of its resources. ADEPT is the front-end interface for accessing the xDD corpus of digital documents. xDD was originally supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation EarthCube building block project (NSF ICER 1343760). Additional ogoing critical support is being provided by DARPA ASKE HR00111990013. Additional support is provided by the DOE and USGS. A through-going objective of all of these projects is to build a cyberinfrastructure that is capable of supporting end-to-end text and data mining (TDM) and knowledge base creation/augmentation activities in any domain of science or scholarship. xDD infrastructure includes the following key components:

1. Automated, rate-controlled and authenticated original document fetching
2. Secure original document storage and bibliographic/source metadata management
3. Automated pre-processing of documents by multiple software tools; ability to quickly deploy new tools/versions of tools across all documents
4. API for basic full-text search and discovery capabilities
5. Ability to pre-index content using external dictionaries
6. Ability to generate fully documented, bibliographically complete testing and development datasets based on user-supplied terms
7. Capacity to support the deployment of user-developed TDM applications across full corpus, with on-demand updates as new relevant documents are acquired

Both ADEPT and xDD are managed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
